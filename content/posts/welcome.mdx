# Welcome

Hello, world! This is my first blog post on my new terminal-style website.

## Why Terminal Style?

I've always loved the aesthetic of old-school terminals. There's something beautiful about:

- Green phosphor text glowing on a black screen
- Monospace fonts that line up perfectly
- The simplicity of text-based interfaces

At the moment, this is what my website looks like with the green theme, but even I feel like this might be a little too much 
for the eyes. So I might actually change this layout later on many many times throughout the future to come.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

1. Technology and programming
2. Ideas and thoughts
3. Projects I'm working on
4. Hobbies and interests
5. Work and relations
6. Things I find interesting

## What's next?

I am planning to work on two main projects in the next few months. 

One is a new webapp for displaying data based on my 'Chaffeur' part-time job I did.
In Korean, it is called '대리', but it is called 'Chauffeur' in English.
So when I was doing this part-time job, I was driving a car for people who drank but had their
vehicles with them. Since it is illegal to drive a car while drunk in Korea, they would call a chauffeur to drive them home.
I have a lot of data and I want to make a webapp that displays the data in a nice way.
I want to make it look like a dashboard with a lot of data and a lot of charts and graphs.

The second project is a new webapp that displays almost everything about a given address on the blockchain. 
I was planning to focus more on the DeFi side of the EVM blockchains, but I might change my mind later on.


Stay tuned for more posts!
