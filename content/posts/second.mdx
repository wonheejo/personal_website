# Joining a Startup

I recently joined a startup as a Business Development. 
This startup is a blockchain company that is focused on building blockchain related infrastructures and services. 
To be exact, they are currently building Explorers and Hub/Portal like pages and interfaces for various blockchain foundations. 
Almost like Etherscan and Blockscout. But what we have in mind is something a lot more complicated and advanced. 
But more on this matter later on in this weblog. 

I want to write more about my journey up to this point as I have joined this startup. 
I initially started my career from a startup and moved two times to larger companies in between, of which all companies were crypto related.
I was more than happy to have joined a company with a job position as a researcher back then, which was what I wanted.
Although, starting my career from a startup had both the goods and the bads. 
Goods, such as unlimited use of everyday funds such as for coffee and lunch up to 20,000 KRW a day, which was a lot but I did not 
know that it was a lot. Being able to work in freedom whether it was at my desk in the main office, or working at the lounge with my macbook. 
Which brings me to one of the main 'Goods', all members were given a Macbook. I was amazed and actually quite happy with these benefits. 
Oh yes, another 'Good' point is that we were quite flexible with are work schedule and were free with when we came into work and when we would leave work 
assuming that we had our 8 hours of work done for that day.

Now, going to the 'Bads', because of the goods, I had only realized that those 'Goods' becamse the 'Bads' after moving into the larger 
companies. Such as, no flexible times of going to work and leaving work because we had to get to work by 9AM and only could leave after 6PM. 
But then again, I guess this can be arguable, as it did set a specific time to work and employees could go home after it. 
Another point is the 20,000 KRW per day I could use in the startup, but not here as we were only given 10,000 KRW for lunch. 
But, it did also have its benefits of a larger company, such as unlimited coffee from an actual commpany owned cafe. 

# Work culture

Now onto the work culture of such startups here in Korea. Some could argue that startups could be similar in turns of work culture all over the world 
and I too, believe so. Perhaps, Korea started to bring in a new kind of work culture as compared to the old, conservative styled work culture that pre-existed and 
dominated the country for decades. 
Having experience in all kinds of work culture, I can say that, many startups really stand out in terms of flexibility and freedom of work.
